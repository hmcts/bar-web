            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and Voice Over)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Enforcement procedure</h2>
        <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations').<br/>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
        <p>HMCTS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>
        <p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances, listed below.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
        <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
        <p>There are multiple h1 headings on the page which removes meaningful structure from the page's content. The headings are not structured correctly and levels are skipped. Text appears to be a heading but is not a heading element and the table is not accessible. This failed to meet 1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A.<br/>
        The focus order of headers is not correct and do not relate directly to content. Heading level 2's have been placed within table data cells  which can cause confusion for screen reader users. This failed to meet 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence Level A.<br/>
        The colour contrast did not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio of text elements. This failed to meet 1.4.3 Contrast Level AA.<br/>
        Text is overlapping when the page is zoomed in at 200%. This failed to meet 1.4.4 Resize Text Level AA.<br/>
        The table flows off the screen when zoomed in at 200%, requiring horizontal scroll. It is also not responsive for mobile devices/phone. This failed to meet 1.4.10 Reflow Level AA.<br/>
        When text spacing is changed the text overlaps and there is loss of content or functionality. This failed to meet 1.4.12 Text Spacing Level AA.<br/>
        There are multiple links and buttons that cannot be tabbed to from the keyboard. This failed to meet 2.1.1 Keyboard Level A.<br/>
        The phase banner cannot be bypassed because it is located above the skip link. This failed to meet 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks Level A.<br/>
        There are no descriptive titles on the Web pages so a user may not know what page they are on. This failed to meet 2.4.2 Page Titled Level A.<br/>
        The purpose of links is not described, and this is not helpful for users of assistive technology like screen readers, especially if they are navigating out of context. This failed to meet 2.4.4 Link Purpose Level A.<br/>
        The headings do not indicate the topic or purpose of the content in that section of the page. This failed to meet 2.4.6 Headings and Labels Level AA.<br/>
        The focus does not remain in the pop-up modal when using the keyboard to tab within modals. This failed to meet 3.2. 1 On Focus Level A.<br/>
        A screen reader user does not immediately hear the "link opens in new window" text when selecting the "add or change user role" button. A visual user may not recognise immediately that the "link opens in a new window" text (under the button) refers to the button due to its placement. This failed to meet 3.2.2 On Input Level A.<br/>
        Errors are not directly communicated to screen reader users as there is no error summary to focus on. This failed to meet 3.3.1 Error identification Level A.<br/>
        Some of the form controls do not have a label and the user will not receive an instruction on what the form controls are used for.  This failed to meet 3.3.2 Labels and Instructions Level A.<br/>
        The dropdown items are presented as text. The links are text elements and users tabbing with the keyboard will not be able to access them. Some icons such as the arrow is a text element, and so will not receive keyboard focus when tabbing. This failed to meet 4.12 Labels and Instructions Level A.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>
        <p>We're committed to ensuring our services are accessible to all our users and that they comply with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG 2.2 Standard. To demonstrate this, we are going to engage with Digital Accessibility Centre to have a further review on [TBC] 06/24<br/>
        We're actively working to improve the identified issues and make them AA-compliant by 31/05/24.</p>
